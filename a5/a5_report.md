AI-Model Based Systems for Enterprise Computing

AI is changing how businesses use computers by using model-based component systems and AI agents. 
AI models that can handle complex, unstructured data and make smart decisions on their own are replacing or adding to traditional rule-based enterprise systems.
The main problem this solves is that traditional systems can't understand natural language, pictures, or make decisions based on the context. 

AI models, especially transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT, are great at things such as analyzing sentiment, processing documents, automating customer service, and making predictions.
The benefits are a lot: smarter automation makes operations run more smoothly, AI chatbots make customer experiences better, predictive insights help people make better decisions, and you can get value from unstructured data like emails, documents, and images. 

Inference microservice containers made by companies like NVIDIA let businesses deploy pretrained and fine-tuned AI models on a large scale.AI models can be used and allocated as microservices, we can add it to existing systems, and used to make predictions through REST APIs, as shown in modern enterprise architectures.
